### Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to the project maintainers or administrators through our official communication channels. We take all reports seriously and will investigate them promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**

   - Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
   - Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**

   - Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
   - Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**

   - Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**

   - Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
   - Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Our Responsibility

As project maintainers and administrators, we are committed to upholding and enforcing this Code of Conduct to ensure a safe, inclusive, and respectful community for all. We will address reported violations promptly and fairly.
